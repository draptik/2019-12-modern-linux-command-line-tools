# Why?

People can try some of the tools which where demonstrated in the session.

Without messing up there own system.

Using docker.

The docker container size: ~700MB (based on Ubuntu 19.10)

# Usage

```sh
./build-container.sh
./run-container.sh
./start-demos.sh
```

# TODOs

- inject/map sensible configs for the demo-tools
