# Post Mortem

- consider using revealjs instead of patat, because
    - combination of text and images might be easier for the audience to follow (images could be
      gifs of running demo code within slide)
    - less switching between slides and terminal (only use terminal for real demos)
    - easier to switch slide themes (light/dark)    
- showcase `lolcat` and `nms` in native gnome-terminal (NOT in tmux session). Looks a lot cooler!
